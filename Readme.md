Jabber-Net [![NuGet][nuget-badge]][nuget] [![Appveyor build][appveyor-badge]][appveyor] [![Travis build][travis-badge]][travis]
==========

âš  This project is **deprecated**, reasons are listed in #110. Please use other
XMPP libraries for .NET:
- [Ubiety.Xmpp.Core](https://github.com/ubiety/Ubiety.Xmpp.Core)
- [SharpXMPP](https://github.com/vitalyster/SharpXMPP/) (maintained by a former
  maintainer of Jabber-Net)

Jabber-Net is a set of .NET classes for sending and receiving Extensible
Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), also known as the Jabber. Client
connections, server component connections, presence, service discovery, and the
like.

Dependencies
------------

This project uses [Paket][paket] dependency manager. Before opening the solution
or building the project, you should install Paket (or Paket bootstrapper) into
`.paket` directory and download the dependencies using the following commands:

```console
$ ./.paket/paket.bootstrapper.exe
$ ./.paket/paket.exe restore
```

For convenience, there is a script `scripts/Install.ps1` that will download
Paket bootstrapper and call these commands automatically. [PowerShell
6.0+][pwsh] is recommended to execute this script.

Consult the script documentation to discover its parameters.

Build and test
--------------

Either use Visual Studio 2017 on Windows or `paket` + `msbuild` / `xbuild` in
your terminal. On Windows:

```console
> .\.paket\paket.exe restore
> msbuild jabber-net.sln /p:Configuration=Debug
> .\packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.4.1\tools\nunit3-console.exe .\test\bin5\Debug\test.dll
```

On Linux:

```console
$ mono ./.paket/paket.exe restore
$ xbuild /p:Configuration=Debug jabber-net.sln
$ mono ./packages/NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.4.1/tools/nunit3-console.exe ./test/bin5/Debug/test.dll
```

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is placed in the `docs` directory. To build HTML
documentation, invoke the following commands (PowerShell syntax):

```powershell
$env:JABBER_NET_ROOT = 'https://fornever.github.io/Jabber-Net'
$fsi = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\4.1\Framework\v4.0\Fsi.exe'
Remove-Item -Recurse .\docs\output
& $fsi docs\generate.fsx
docs\output\index.html
```

There's a convenience script `scripts/Build-Docs.ps1` for that.

You may then publish the `docs/output` directory through a Web server, or just
read the documentation from your local drive.

Packaging
---------

To build [NuGet][nuget] package for Jabber-Net, use the script
`scripts/Package.ps1`. If you want to push this package to the Nuget feed, use
`scripts/Push-Package.ps1`.

Consult the scripts documentation to get the information about their parameters.

Licensing
---------

The project source code is generally licensed under the terms of LGPLv3. Please
